I am pleased with this result, and very grateful to my colleagues for their support today. There is a big job before us to unite our party and the country, to negotiate the best possible deal as we leave the EU, and to make Britain work for everyone. I am the only candidate capable of delivering these three things as prime minister, and tonight it is clear that I am also the only one capable of drawing support from the whole of the Conservative party. I look forward to continuing the debate about Britains future  in parliament and across the country.
