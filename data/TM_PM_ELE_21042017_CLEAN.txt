Its great to be here in Bolton, fresh from the House of Commons, fresh from winning a vote in the House of Commons which approved my decision to hold a general election on the 8th of June. Its the right decision, its in the national interest. And thats what this election is about providing the strong and stable leadership this country needs to take Britain through Brexit and beyond. Its about strengthening our hand in the negotiations that lie ahead. And its about sticking to our plan for a stronger Britain that will enable us to secure that more stable and secure future for this country and take the right long term decision for the future. Its about strong and stable leadership in the national interest. And you only get that strong and stable leadership by voting for the Conservatives. Because thats what Conservatives government provides. And just look at what weve done. When I took over as Prime Minister, there were predictions of immediate financial crash, of economic danger. But we see consumer confidence remains high, we see record numbers of jobs, and economic growth that has exceeded all expectations. When I took over as Prime Minister people said the country was divided that it could never be brought together. But actually what I see today in this country is a unity of purpose  a desire for the Government to get on with the job of putting Brexit in to place and making a success of it. When I took over as Prime Minister, the country needed clear vision and strong leadership to ensure that we got on with that job of delivering on Brexit for the British people and thats exactly what we did. We delivered that strong and stable leadership, we delivered the certainty that strong and stable leadership can give. And thats what leadership looks like. Now theres a very clear choice at this election. Its a choice between strong and stable leadership under the Conservatives, or weak and unstable coalition of chaos led by Jeremy Corbyn. And that is very clear. Lets look  the other parties are lining up to prop up Jeremy Corbyn. Weve seen it with the Liberal Democrats, and we see it with Nicola Sturgeons Scottish nationalists. Theyre very clear that they want to do everything they can to frustrate our Brexit negotiations. To undermine the job that we have to do, the task that lies ahead. Do everything to stop us from being able to take Britain forward. And its their tunnel vision focus on independence that actually provides uncertainty. They want to pull the strings, try to pull the strings of this election, prop up Jeremy Corbyn and provide more risk and uncertainty for the British people and thats not in Britains interests. So its only a vote for the Conservatives that can deliver, and every vote for the Conservatives is a vote for me and local Conservative candidates, and its a vote to ensure that we have that strong and stable leadership that we need to take us through Brexit and beyond. Every vote for me and the local Conservative candidates here and across Britain is a vote to deliver on that plan for a stronger Britain and a more secure future for us all. And if we have that certainty of five more years of strong and stable leadership then we can ensure that were delivering for people, for ordinary working people up and down the country, across the whole United Kingdom. Yes getting the right deal with the European Union, ensuring that we get that good negotiation, that we deliver on that deep and special partnership with the European Union. Negotiating other deals for export of British goods and services. A country that is showing that we can be leaders in preventing terrorism and fighting modern slavery. But its also about getting the right deal for ordinary working people here at home, and thats about building a strong Britain. Britain is the strongest country in Europe in terms of economic growth and national security. Its about building a stronger economy. Its about creating well paid secure jobs. Its about ensuring that there is opportunity for all. That we provide a good school place for every child. That there is affordable housing. That people can get on in their lives. Its about ensuring that we create a more united nation. That we take action against the extremists who want to divide us, and that we stand up to the separatists who want to break up our country. So its providing that strong and stable leadership. That certainty. That stability for the future, and thats going to be our message as go out in to our election campaign. And Im looking forward to it. Were going to fight a positive and optimistic campaign about the future of this country. Im going to be getting out and about around the country. Im going to be visiting communities in every part of the United Kingdom. And Im looking forward to taking our case out there to people. Because this is the case  that it is only with the Conservatives that you get the strong and stable leadership that this country needs to see us through Brexit and beyond. Only we can give that plan for a stronger Britain. For a more secure future. But only you can give us the mandate. So vote for a strong and stable leadership in this country. Vote for the strong and stable leadership this country needs. Give me the mandate to lead Britain. Give me the mandate to speak for Britain. Give me the mandate to fight for Britain, and give me the mandate to deliver for Britain.
