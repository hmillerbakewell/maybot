Ramadan is a unique and special time for Muslims in Britain and around the world. It is a time for them to renew their faith in God and increase their devotion and spirituality. A time when, despite the long summer days, Muslims across Britain will find strength through devotion to fulfil one of the five pillars of their religion. Ramadan fosters a strong sense of community spirit, reflected in the way mosques open their doors and welcome people of all faiths and none to share in the Iftar meal  something I have experienced in my own constituency of Maidenhead. It is an important chance for people from all walks of life to meet together, discuss and share experiences with their neighbours, and to increase familiarity and foster friendships. This Ramadan, let us celebrate the way in which this festival of peace, reflection and religious devotion brings people closer together. And let us say to Muslims here in Britain and across the world, Ramadan Kareem.
