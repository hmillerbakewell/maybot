I send my warmest wishes to Muslims around the world, and here in the United Kingdom, who are celebrating Eid al Adha this week. And I congratulate everyone who has performed the Hajj this year. At this special time, British Muslims will gather together with family, friends and neighbours to pray, to exchange gifts and to share meals. Amidst these celebrations, they will also remember those in need, by extending a hand of friendship and compassion to those less fortunate than themselves. That generosity towards others is shown all year round by British Muslims, through charitable giving and service in the community. Indeed, British Muslims, and people of Muslim origin, make a huge contribution to all walks of life in the United Kingdom. They help to enrich the successful multi racial, multi faith democracy that is twenty first century Britain. As we celebrate this happy occasion here in the United Kingdom, we will also keep in our thoughts and prayers those around the world who will be marking this festival in places of conflict and insecurity. This festivals commemoration of Abrahams willingness to sacrifice for his faith is a reminder of the shared roots of the worlds great Abrahamic faiths. And in their warm spirit of neighbourliness and compassion, the Eid celebrations demonstrate common values in which we can all share. So Eid Mubarak. I hope that this will be a wonderful occasion for everyone who is taking part.
